        The following convention is adopted, according to what required by
        the SALT module of DRAGON5:
        - lattice made of rectangular cells: the type of geometry depends on
          the number of cells:
            - only one cell - the type is RECTANGLE_TRAN
            - more than one cell - the type is RECTANGLE_SYM
        - lattice made of hexagonal cells: the type of geometry depends on the
          number of cells:
            - only one cell - the type is HEXAGON_TRAN
            - more than one cell - the type is ISOTROPIC

        The type of geometry is expressed as a value of the 'GeometryType'
        enumeration.
        Given the type of geometry, the corresponding type of boundary is
        set as well.

        Method for updating the lattice geometry with the given compound

        The SALOME ID of the compound is provided, given which the GEOM
        object is retrieved.
        A common operation between the stored lattice compound and the

        - If None, it means that the lattice position has changed. However,
          if the geometrical properties are different, a warning is raised
          as the center of the new geometry cannot be univocally determined.
          In this case, the method `update_geometry_from_center` should be
          called. If no changes in the geometrical properties are present,
          the lattice (and all the related attributes) is translated in the
          new position. A rotation is performed as well, if needed.
        - If not None, it means that the two compounds shares all the lattice
          or a part of it. If the geometric properties of the common result
          and the new compound are different, the same check is performed on
          the previous and current lattice:

          - If different, nothing can be said about its center: a warning
            is raised notifying the need to call the method
            `update_geometry_from_center`.
          - If equal, the new compound is just placed in a different
            position: the current one is translated and a rotation is
            performed as well, if needed.

          If the common result and the new compound are the same, then a
          rotation is performed, if needed. A comparison on the previous and
          actual lattice area is performed to check if any symmetry could be
          applied. In any case, if the areas are different, the lattice
