"""
Use case showing the construction of an assembly where the lattice is made of
hexagonal cells of different dimensions: several rings of hexagonal cells
characterised by a smaller size are overlapped by others of a greater size.
The result is that the geometry layout of the small cells being overlapped is
cut, which is a scenario that cannot occur in real-case situations.
Hence, those cells are restored by removing all their circular regions and by
setting their 'MATERIAL' property to the same value.
The lattice is enclosed within a hexagon-shaped box with different thicknesses.
Its type of geometry is set so that the resulting surface geometry representation
applies BCs of type TRAN on the borders of the assembly; this implies the use
of a cycling tracking in SALT.
The built lattice is shown in the 3D viewer of SALOME and its surface geometry
representation exported to an output TDT file.
